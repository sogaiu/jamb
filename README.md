This repository houses bits necessary for `janet-pm` with some slight
modifications.  ATM, its primary purpose is for study.  The name has
been changed to `jamb` so that it is possible to use this alongside
`janet-pm`.

Pretty much all of the code comes from:

* [spork](https://github.com/janet-lang/spork) by bakpakin and contributors
* [jeep](https://github.com/pyrmont/jeep) by pyrmont and contributors

Thanks to pyrmont for the name.
